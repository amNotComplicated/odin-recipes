# odin-recipes

The current project was about applying everything I have learned so far about HTML. I have created a project about cooking recipes.

The homepage contain links that lead to all the recipes that I have chosen.

There are 3 different recipes pages, on each we can find :
  - recipe name
  - image of the recipe
  - brief description
  - ingredients needed
  - steps to follow

I have learned to create an HTML page, use titles depend on the situation, incorporate images, create unordered lists, ordered lists and create links that lead to another page of my own website/project.
